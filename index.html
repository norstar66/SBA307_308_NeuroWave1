        <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <p>So many kids hate school, and let's face it,
            our education system kind of sucks. Teachers are underpaid and spread too thin,
            and their job is really difficult. Everyone's needs are different, and that is
            impossible to provide with our current system.

            In the workforce, some of the most skilled laborers are not prepared for working
            with AI or the rapid pace of technology. Imagine if you looked forward to learning a new
            skill even after a long day. Or not having to wonder if your kids did their homework.

            Our system is much more like an adventure, with complex storylines that reinforce learning and
            adapt to the needs of the individual. NeuroWave can solve so many problems, and possibly change
            the world.</p>
