        <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
        <!-- Describes current problems with traditional education systems -->
        <p>
            So many kids hate school, and let's face it, our education system kind of sucks.
            Teachers are underpaid and spread too thin, and their job is really difficult.
            Everyone's needs are different, and that is impossible to provide with our current system.
        </p>
        <!-- Highlights lack of preparedness in the workforce for AI -->
        <p>
            In the workforce, some of the most skilled laborers are not prepared for working with AI or the rapid pace of technology.
            Imagine if you looked forward to learning a new skill even after a long day. Or not having to wonder if your kids did their homework.
        </p>
        <!-- Conveys how NeuroWave transforms learning into an engaging adventure -->
        <p>
            Our system is much more like an adventure, with complex storylines that reinforce learning and adapt to the needs of the individual.
            NeuroWave can solve so many problems, and possibly change the world.
